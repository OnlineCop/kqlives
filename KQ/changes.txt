NOTES:

In the source code for KQ, I've added a "DEBUGMODE" option under the OPTIONS menu.  It is only accessible when you compile in DEBUGMODE, otherwise, it isn't even compiled into the program.  It will allow the player/user to change "debugging" value from 0..4, where each level of debugging will offer different features (listed below).  Basically, the higher the DEBUGMODE value, the more functionality (read: cheating) the player/user can achieve.

This is basically how we'll determine how much "debugging" will open up to the user/player:
  0: None at all (as if not even compiled into the game)
  1: Simple error logging ("Could not load...", "Error in script...", "Alt+X pressed...")
  2: Visual differences (enemy stats during battle, starting title page, etc.)
  3: Game stats/player modification (players cannot be killed during battle, etc.)
  4: Show map Attributes (zones, obstacles, NPC #s, etc.)

You may note that in the code, these are not progressively exclusive (value "4" will also include features from value "2").  This may become tedious down the road when we are constantly receiving "allegro.log" errors, so we may rethink this later.

-----

KQ_CHEATS has been modified to affect whether the player can use "cheat.lob" during their game, and affects things like never dying during battle, etc.

-----

Updated P_TALK_TSORIN so the player is required to go back and talk to Derig.  Whether you've found Derig before or not, this script should compensate for where you meet with him.


TODO:

Add other ideas for debugging as needed.
