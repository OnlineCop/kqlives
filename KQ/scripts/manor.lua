-- manor - "Nostik's manor southwest of Ekla"

-- /*
-- {
-- Which globals should we have for manor?
--
-- P_MANOR
--   (0) New game; You haven't spoken to the butler yet
--   (1) Butler has spoken to you, or you have no new recruits yet
--   (2) You've recruited others and they're waiting around the table
--
-- P_PLAYERS
--   (0) You haven't recruited anyone yet
--   (1..7) You have others in your party
--
-- When the game starts, Nostik debriefs everybody quickly and then offers to
-- go into detail for whoever wants to stay.  We should script it so everyone
-- else leaves immediately (walks out the door) and you're left at the table.
--
-- Before you can leave yourself, the butler, Hunert, will stop to talk to you
-- and fill you in, as well as give you some money to start the quest.
--
-- When you return to the manor, the dining room should be empty unless you
-- have 'recruited' other party members into your team.  If you have, then
-- those members are sitting in their places around the table.  Even the
-- person that is trailing you will be sitting there; no one will join your
-- little "procession" until you leave the manor.  When you talk to the party
-- members around the table, PH's team selector will be activated.
-- Irregardless of who you choose, they don't 'jump up' and start trailing you
-- immediately; they stay around the table until you leave.  This prevents
-- 'jumping' when a character is traded.  The 'removed' character would
-- otherwise magically disappear from behind you and appear at the table, and
-- the person you're recruiting will disappear from their seat and be standing
-- behind/under you.  I just don't like that; it just looks like bad coding.
--
-- Quick reference:
--
--  SENSAR   0
--  SARINA   1
--  CORIN    2
--  AJATHAR  3
--  CASANDRA 4
--  TEMMIN   5
--  AYLA     6
--  NOSLOM   7
--  Nostik   8
--  Hunert   9
