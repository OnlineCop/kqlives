-- manor - "Nostik's manor southwest of Ekla"

-- "{
-- Which globals should we have for manor?
--
-- P_MANOR
--   (0) New game; Nostik hasn't spoken yet
--   (1) Nostik explained the quest, but you haven't yet spoken to the butler
--   (2) Butler has already spoken to you
--   (3) You have recruited others and they are waiting around the table
--    *  We have to somehow "set_progress(P_MANOR, 3)"... it's not active yet.
--
-- P_PLAYERS
--   (0) You haven't recruited anyone yet
--   (1..7) You have others in your party
--
-- When the game starts, Nostik debriefs everybody quickly and then offers to
-- go into detail for whoever wants to stay.  We should script it so everyone
-- else leaves immediately (walks out the door) and you're left at the table.
--
-- Before you can leave yourself, the butler, Hunert, will stop to talk to you
-- and fill you in, as well as give you some money to start the quest.
--
-- When you return to the manor, the dining room should be empty unless you
-- have 'recruited' other party members into your team.  If you have, then
-- those members are sitting in their places around the table.  Even the
-- person that is trailing you will be sitting there; no one will join your
-- little "procession" until you leave the manor.  When you talk to the party
-- members around the table, PH's team selector will be activated.
-- Irregardless of who you choose, they don't 'jump up' and start trailing you
-- immediately; they stay around the table until you leave.  This prevents
-- 'jumping' when a character is traded.  The 'removed' character would
-- otherwise magically disappear from behind you and appear at the table, and
-- the person you're recruiting will disappear from their seat and be standing
-- behind/under you.  I just don't like that; it just looks like bad coding.

-- way is to create a struct with '.in_party == 1' or something.  A third is
-- to only set char_array[x] to the characters ID# if they joined, null if
-- not.
