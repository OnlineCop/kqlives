This game requires the following libraries (not included):

Allegro Game Library 4.2
Dumb Sound Engine 0.9
The libaldmb1 Runtime library
Lua 5.0

Older or newer versions of these libraries will probably not work. Allegro usually breaks ABI
compatability at point releases. Lua 5.1 will not work with this binary.
