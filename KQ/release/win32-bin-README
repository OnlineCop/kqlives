This game requires the following libraries (included):

Allegro Game Library 4.2
Lua 5.0
The Dumb library is compiled statically in the Windows release?

Older or newer versions of these libraries will probably not work. Allegro usually breaks ABI
compatability at point releases. Lua 5.1 will not work with this binary.
