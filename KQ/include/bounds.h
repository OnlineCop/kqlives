/*! \brief Bounding area box
 *
 * A boundary is a viewable area on the map.
 * These are set up in the map editor to remove the need to call set_view
 * in the scripts. If the player is inside a bounding box' coordinate, then
 * the map will only redraw those tiles, else it will redraw everything on the
 * map.
