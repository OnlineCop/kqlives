   <font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif"> Well, it's been about a month
 since I announced that I would not be finishing  KQ. This update is to tell
 you that this page and the KQ download will be gone  soon. If you want KQ,
 now is the time to get it... of course, this zip just  contains the source
 and data files. This is however, the most current source.  This version
of  the source is using LUA for scripting, and has several other  modifications
 that make it a bit easier to use. Techincally, all that's  required to finish
 making the game is to draw up and script the remainder of  the maps and
story...  you wouldn't have to touch the engine at all if you did  not want
to. Anyways,  this page will disappear over the Labour-Day weekend and  the
only way to  get the source will be to e-mail me... but you'd have to find
 my e-mail address somewhere else because there will be nothing here. <br>
