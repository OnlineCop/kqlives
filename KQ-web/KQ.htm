		<p>For diehard fans of console RPGs, KQ might be just what the doctor ordered.</p>
		<p>Made in the style of early SNES Final Fantasy games, KQ (which doesn't stand for anything) features good graphics, great sound, a superb storyline, and an interesting items system.</p>
		<p>KQ tells the tale of a quest to retrieve a magical staff for Nostik, a mysterious wizard.  Eight different people embark on this quest, and you are able to play the part of any of them.  Along the way, you can enlist the help of one more quester to help you on your way.</p>
		<p>KQ takes you through a goblin temple, under a mountain range through a perilous cave, and through many other exotic locales.  Many different monsters and enemies lie in your path waiting to thwart you.</p>
		<p>As console RPGs go, KQ is quite high in difficulty.  If you stay to fight every monster you meet, prepare to die often.</p>
		<p>KQ features very nice tile-based graphics, although some of the graphics are taken from earlier Final Fantasy games.  It also features nice digital music tracks.</p>
		<p>In KQ, items are not shared between a party, but each person has his own set.  This can be cumbersome at first, because you have to worry about who has which item.  You can trade items to other members of your party.</p>
		<p>As party members gain more experience and levels, they will learn new magic spells.  Spells can also be learned from spell books, which can be found or bought at magic shops.</p>
		<p>As characters gain experience, they will also gain special power in certain elements, such as earth, fire, or water.  The more power a character has behind a certain type of magic, the more powerful his/her spells of that type will be, and the better he/she will be able to defend him/herself against magic of that type.  Some characters are born with natural power behind certain types of magic.</p>
		<p>KQ is definitely an Allegro game to keep your eye on.</p>
