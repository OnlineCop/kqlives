       <font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">Well, I guess  that's it.
 I  won't  be finishing the game. I've been see-sawing between trying to
 complete  it  and just admitting that I have no interest in the game anymore.
 Well,  I'm  done trying to convince myself to finish it. I simply have no
desire   to work on this, or any other game, anymore. I no longer have the
need to   immerse  myself in programming as a distraction from real life.
Life is good  again  and I don't want to waste my time with stuff I am not
interested in  anymore.  <br>
       <br>
       I got into programming when I didn't have anyone to play  AD&amp;D 
with   anymore. I wanted to take campaign ideas and characters and stuff 
and make   a game. Well, I started doing that with Verge and The Silver Circle
and  then I made  KQ  to develop  an engine for The Silver Circle and then
 KQ   turned into a whole game  on it's own. Well, now I'm going back to
pen and  paper. I've tried all different  kinds of console and computer RPGs
and although  Morrowind comes close, no RPG  has ever fully satisfied me
like pen and paper  RPGs do. No computer/console will  ever duplicate the
social element that  real people add to an RPG... online RPGs  can be pretty
good, but it's still  not good enough. <br>
       <br>
       Whatever, I don't  need to get too long-winded about all of this.
I  am  packing  up everything I have  and putting in a big zip with some
notes  on  how I had  everything structured for  development... it's pretty
bad actually.  All of  the current source and stuff  will be there, but the
PCXs and WAVs  and stuff  will only be in the data files.  You can extract
them if you need  to edit  them. The only problem you may  encounter is that
I use perl for  some parsing  and miscellaneous crap. I taught  myself perl 
for the purpose  of helping with coding so it's pretty rough stuff.  <br>
       <br>
       Anyways, check the readme in the zip... enjoy... and sorry to all
those     people I told I would finish this. I guess, in hindsight, releasing
this    game to  the public before it was done may not have been such a great
idea.    If I hadn't  released it before it was done, at least I wouldn't
feel bad    about abandoning  it. <br>
